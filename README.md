# Hello, Github! :hand:

```js
import io;
main := (":D")=>(print);
```

I'm RedoC, an open-source contributor. :hammer:  
I am the youngest Swift Student Challenge Winner in Korea (when I was 12 years old).
Also making [StreamCode World](https://github.com/Diggie-Bro/StreamCode), Learning PS.

My work is mostly uploading to Github :octocat:.   
It is better to see it. Check it out!
